- America's Homicide Surge: https://www.city-journal.org/update-on-americas-homicide-surge
    - "Another aspect of our brief that gained attention involved politics: Are homicide rates, as well as the recent increase in them, primarily a Republican or a Democratic problem? Some have tried to push the narrative of a “red-state” murder wave, noting that many of the highest state-level murder rates are found in the GOP South. But as my colleague Rafael Mangual recently explained, states are a poor focus for this kind of analysis. Policing and prosecution mostly occur at the local level, and crime problems in red states are often concentrated in their blue cities."

- *Music being omnipresent in the post-Ipod era*: https://twitter.com/IvanVendrov/status/1617306916253990912
    - "I've always felt uncomfortable with the omnipresence of music in our post-iPod era. I think it's because music is a substitute for internal emotional regulation."

- The Office is Killing You (Meritocracy over Bureacracy): https://ramp.beehiiv.com/p/office-killing
    - "The office experience was always supposed to be about the work product, a meritocracy. Over time it devolved into a bureaucratic lust for power. Don't waste years of your life letting it drag you down."

- The Index Mindset: https://luttig.substack.com/p/indexmindset
    - "Abandoning the index mindset may be more valuable than ever. When everyone is indexing, their collective trance distorts reality. That’s your opportunity. There isn’t a singular answer about when to adopt versus abandon the index. But the index mindset is sedative, a substitute for conviction. And conviction pays off, as Howard Marks [succinctly put it](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2001-10-04-what-lies-ahead.pdf?sfvrsn=2#page=7): “if you wait at a bus stop long enough, you're sure to catch your bus, while if you keep wandering all over the bus route, you may miss them all."
